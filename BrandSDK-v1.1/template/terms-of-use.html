Any dispute relating to the Terms or the Site may be litigated only in a court having jurisdiction and venue in Sacramento County for state court causes of action and in the Eastern District of California for federal court causes of action. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Terms.

<p><b>Arbitration</b></p>

<p><i>Generally</i><br />
BY USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; (ii) claims that arose before these or any prior Terms were adopted; (iii) claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iv) claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You agree, by entering into these Terms of Use, that you and our Brand each are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms of Use.</p> 

<p><i>Opt Out</i><br />
Notwithstanding the above, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE WHEN YOU FIRST ACCEPT THESE TERMS (the "Opt Out Deadline"). You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling <a href="tel:{phone_number}" class="phone-number-link">{phone_number}</a> or emailing <a href="mailto:consumerrelations@{domain}" class="email-link">consumerrelations@{domain}</a>. to request the opt out form. Any opt out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue any claim in arbitration.</p>

<p><i>Notice of Disputes</i><br />
For all disputes and claims, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your dispute or claim by sending a written Notice of Dispute (the "Notice") to us at the following address: Office for Dispute Resolution, E. & J. Gallo Winery , 1541 Cummins Drive, Modesto, CA 95358. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the dispute or claim and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (a "Demand"). If our Brand and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute or claim within 30 days after Notice is received, you or our Brand may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Use and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Use. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Terms, including but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Terms are void or voidable.</p>
<p>The payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated hereunder will be governed by the AAA Rules; provided, however that for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. Except for claims under $75,000 determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of attorneys' fees in such arbitration proceedings even if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p>
<p>Unless we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.</p>

<p><b>Class Action Waiver</b><br />
YOU AND OUR BRAND AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both of us agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other User, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</p>
<p>EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE OTHER PARTY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS.</p>
<p>The Terms are accepted upon your use of the Site or any of its features and is further affirmed upon you becoming a Member (if applicable). The Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and our Brand regarding the use of Site and its services and features. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of the Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from the Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
